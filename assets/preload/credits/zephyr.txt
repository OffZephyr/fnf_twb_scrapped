MOD OWNER & SUPERVISOR
Hey I'm Zephyr ! I'm the one that wrote all of these descriptions.
Did you know you have a pretty face~ ?
MAIN SOURCE/LUA DEV
As the only source code/lua dev in this mod team, I had to a lot of stuff for this mod, that includes the build itself, making the backgrounds , the characters and the songs work, and a bunch of other boring stuff. Shout out to the Official Psych Engine discord server, they helped me a lot with my dumb coding mistakes!
UI DESIGNER
Designed the Credits Menu, Endings Menu, Freeplay Menu and Credits Selection Menu.

"I'd also like to say that I enjoyed working on this project a lot, and I'm hoping to continue working on it, with future updates and new lore! Thanks for playing and I hope you enjoyed this mod ! <3"
